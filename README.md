CardCarousel
===================


CardCarousel is a custom ViewPager for Android. It animates the cards as you scroll through the ViewPager by skewing and moving them within the layout itself. Each card layout in the ViewPager is overlapping each other to by setting the PageMargin to a negative value. This is very much experimental and needs more work for being stable.
